35,Tower 2-BTU meter MWhr dip on 30.08.2008 2159to 2200hrs(To Meera),I&C,"Dear Steven and Nam

Refer to Shan email , we have encounter that the BTU for T2 (QQ value) has dip to zero and then recover for 1 period.

We have look at the system log and did not receive any profibus loss communication.  A check on our E+H meter has not seen any abnormal.

From the log we capture , all the BTU value except the MWrh has dipped and I am suspecting there is a loss of communication with the QQ point.

Can you advise us what is the approach to look at this problem as it has an impact on our invoicing to customer.


Best Regards

Ang/Meera

2 Sep 2008- Meera informed awaiting ABB reply.On Hold,


As per Stephen E-mail reply that currently we don't know why this happend so we monitor closely this issue to come again. and below attached the e-mail.


Hi Meera,

This dip is observed from the kWhr, the totalizer value done in the BTU meter. What we can know of is the comms is fine, since all other values such s temp, kW is varying during this period. The dip may only happened in a very shot time, and our trend is sampling only at 10sec intervals.

BTU meter calculation seems not affected since it is accumulating the same counter values after the dip.

Difficult to see what problems, pls keeep a lookout if this happened again??

Ang

Dear Ang-san,

Good afternoon.
Regarding to avobe mentioned subject, I've check with our electrical
engineer today.

They have not find root cause yet.
Progress of investigation is shown as follows.

Problem had occured at power on of microcomputer panel.

There is CPU and Master Serial Controller chip(SC-M) on MAIN BOARD.
There is Slave Serial Controller chip(SC-S) on each DO/DI BOARD.

When power source turns ON, micro computer panel is going to start to check
how many DI/DO BOARD are connected.
This action, Connection confirm sequence, is done as follows.

1. CPU send command to SC-M to start Connection cinfirm sequence.
2. SC-M send signal to serch signal to each SC-S one by one.
3. If DI BOARD or DO BOARD is connected, ackowledge signal will be send
back to SC-M immediately.
4. If ackowledge signal can be recieved, SC-M recognize that there is no
BOARD connected.
5. After finishing this Connection confirm sequence, SC-M send RESET signal
to all DI/DO BOARD simultaneously.
6. By recieving RESET signal, each SC-S turn from checking mode to nomal
mode. Then DI/DO BOARD can work normally.

By investigation with reappearance test at our factory, it is confirmed
that wave shape of RESET signal is deformed and SC-S remain checkng mode in
this case.
Because SC-S can not turn to normal mode, ON/OFF signal for valves can not
be recieved by DO BOARD3 and relays never work.

If signal transfer speed is slower, deformation of wave shape become
bigger.
Transfer speed at trouble had been set to 39.1kbps.
Now transfer speed is set to 104.2kbps by turn off dip switch No.2.
It is confirmed that under 50kbps action of DO BOARD become unstable by
reappearance test.
And also if DI BOARD is not connected to DO BOARD, deformation become
bigger.
(This is caused from difference of impedance.)
In case of WC-1, DO BOARD1 is connected to DI BOARD1 but DO BOARD3 is not
connected with DI BOARD.

All the design is mached with specification of chip maker and there is no
limitation of transfer speed mentioned.
So they are now asking the reason to chip maker.

Thanks,
Toru OTSU

5/10/10 - Reply from Apeco on Action By Tony Ong
From:	""Tony Ong"" <tonyong@apeco.com.sg>

Dear Ang
 
I would like to highlight some issue which I have mentioned in 2 weeks meeting ago.

 
We have 8 actuators valves in CTs. 4 nos. is XV and 4 nos. is FCV!
 
We have send the technical report to you last week mentioning 4 nos. of XV has changed the pin to dia. 16mm type. Please refer to attached report!
 
As for the 4 nos. of FCV, I mentioned 2 weeks ago that we will bring in a spare actuator & do the necessary slot machining and change the pin to dia. 16mm as well. So now waiting for the spare actuator to arrive!
 
Trisome has been on site yesterday & will also come today to solve the jam problem and tested it out to SDC open/close operation. However, permanent solution is still to replace the pin size!
 
With above explanations, we would like to reconfirm that the “Jammed” Valve is FCV type. Tag no: P2-FCV-250D-1.
 
Thank you.
 
Regards
 
Tony Ong

2. We have observed that there is a process deviation of 1.5degC between the CT outlet and water chiller condenser inlet temperature (can be attributed to the long pipe flow from Level 1 to B5 where the water tempeature has cooled down.)

                1)To close FCVs to 20% after last compressor stopped - This is to avoid from supplying high temperature chilled water to customers(as compressor stopped &                   vane closing)
                2)To close FCVs fully & automatically switch to ""AUTO-EXT' after chilled water pump stopped - This is to help so that when next chiller start-up, no                   worries for process trip for chillers due to operators didn't normalise FCVs.

IT IS CONFIRMED THAT THE ACCURACY OF THE TE IS +/-0.1 % ( 0.12% IN THEIR EMAIL) OF THE RESISTANCE. SO AT 0 DEG C THE ERROR IS +/- 0.12% OF 1000 OHM WHICH IS 1.2 OHM. THAT IS EQUAL TO ABOUT +/- 0,3 DEG C IF MEASURING AT 0 DEG C. 

FOR OUR APPLICATION OF 4.5 DEG C OR  10 / 11 DEG C , THE ERROR WILL BE SIGHTLY HIGHER. IN GENERAL YOU CAN SAY THE ACCURACY OF THIS TE IS ABOUT  +/- 0.3 DEG C. NOTE THIS IS NOT INCLUDING THE ERROR CAUSED BY THE CABLING AS IT IS ONLY A 2-WIRE SYSTEM (NO CABLING COMPENSATION). THE ERROR CAUSED BY THE WIRE RESISTANCE OF THE CABLE IS DEPENDENT ON THE EACH CABLE.

HOWEVER WHEN COMPARED TO THE SECOND CHANNEL OF THE ULTRASONIC FLOW METER                                     WHICH MONITORS THE TOTAL FLOW OF THE COMMON RETURN HEADER, THE READING SHOWS THAT THE TOTAL FLOW DOES NOT TALLY WITH THE SUM                                      OF THE INDIVIDUAL CHILLER FLOW. THE COMMON HEADER FLOW ALWAYS SHOWS A HIGER FLOW THAN THE SUM OF INDIVIDUAL CHILLER FLOW                                     EXCEPT WHEN WC-2 IS RUNNING ALONE.

                    STATUS OF INVESTIGATION: IT WAS FOUND THAT CT-18 HIGH VIBRATION OCCURS MORE LIKELY WHEN MANY NEIGHBOURING CTS ARE RUNNING ON AUTO WITH VSD SPEED AT ABOUT +/- 66%. PROBABLE CAUSE IS DUE TO STUCTURE RESONANCE.
                                             OPERATION INFORMED TO PUT THE VSD ON MANUAL CONTROL AT >70% OR <60% WHEN THE AUTO SIGNAL IS AROUND THE +/-66% AND CT-18 VIB IS HIGH.

10/03/2014 - LEC/CYW/DBR : TESTING DONE ON 3/1/2014 SHOWS THAT LOCAL HANDHELD VIBRATION SENSOR READINGS FOR CT-18 AND OTHER CTS & DCIS ARE VERY CLOSE.
                           ON 27/2/2014 THE WHOLE GROUP-2 COOLING TOWERS WERE OFF. TREND FOR ALL THESE CT SHOWS THAT ALL THE VIBRATION TRANSMITTERS READ
                           CLOSE TO ZERO. BASED ON ANALYSIS OF THE ABOVE AND FEW OTHER TESTS, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE CT-18 VIBRATION TRANSMITTER
                           IS WORKING NORMALLY. OPERATIONS IS ADVISE TO CHECK ON OTHER ISSUES (E.G. STRUCTURE) ON THE HIGH VIBRATION OF CT-18 DURING OPERATIONS.

                         ABLE TO TURN AT THE REMOTE POSITION.
                         DISCOVERED A ISSUE THAT BECAUSE THE HANDWHEEL POSITION IS AT THE BOTTOM,
                         AND DUE THE HEAVY WEIGHT OF THE HANDWHEEL FOR THE 3 BIG XV VALVE FOR 
                         HEX-1, HEX-2 & HEX-3, IT MAY HAVE PROBLEMS INTERMITTENLY DUE TO THE
                         HANDWHEEL POSITION DROPPED TO THE LOCAL MANUAL POSITION AND CAUSE THE
                         XV VALVES NOT ABLE TO BE CONTROL REMOTELY.
                         I&C TEAM IS NOW PLANNING TO ROTATE THE XV VALVES ACTUATOR POSITION SUCH
                         THAT THE HANDWHEEL POSITIONS FOR THESE 3 VALVES WILL BE AT THE SIDE
                         INSTEAD OF BOTTOM.

A test was carried by reducing the number of cooling tower in operation so as to                  achieve the designed pressure head.  Hot water was confirmed flowing in the plumb coil after the pressure head was increased to the design                  value."

ACTIONS TAKEN: 
During Commissioning of Fuji Electric VSD (Jan 2017), it has been tripped few times due to the phase unbalance fault from Motor Protection Relay (SPAM 150C).
Upon investigation noticed that the Fuji electric VSD got 1400KVA isolation transformer cause the phase unbalance. So, we reviewed & revised the setting as follows for the past 2 years.

STEP 1: Initial Protection setting: UI - 20% UT -20Sec
STEP 2: Increase Protection setting: UI - 20% UT - 50sec
STEP 3: Increase Protection setting: UI - 30% UT - 50Sec
STEP 4: Increase Protection setting: UI - 40% UT - 80Sec
STEP 5: Replaced Motor Protection relay & T&C

All the above protection settings were proposed by OEM (MHI as well as Fuji Electric) and approved by LEW (Mr.Aqil).
Even after all the above corrective actions, we couldn't able to fix the phase unbalance issue. 
Based on the latest study by OEM, proposed to disable the phase unbalance protection in motor protection relay (SPAM 150C). The proposal has been approved by Mr. Aqil, LEW. 
To avoid nuisance tripping and the proposal from OEM has been approved by LEW, it is recommended to disable the phase unbalance protection setting in Motor Protection Relay.
According to MHI, the phase unbalance protection setting for FUJI Electric VSD is 14% for the duration of 5 Seconds
